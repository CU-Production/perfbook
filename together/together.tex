\Epigraph{You don't learn how to shoot and then learn how to launch
	  and then learn to do a controlled spin---you learn to
	  launch-shoot-spin.}{\emph{Ender's Shadow}, Orson Scott Card}

% And the paragraph preceding this is also instructive:
% ``I may be pissed off, but that doesn't mean I can't learn.''

This \lcnamecref{chp:Putting It All Together}
gives some hints on concurrent-programming puzzles.
\Cref{sec:together:Counter Conundrums}
considers counter conundrums,
\cref{sec:together:Refurbish Reference Counting}
refurbishes reference counting,
\cref{sec:together:Hazard-Pointer Helpers}
helps with hazard pointers,
\cref{sec:together:Sequence-Locking Specials}
surmises on sequence-locking specials,
\cref{sec:together:RCU Rescues}
and
reflects on RCU rescues.
Finally,
although the best performance and scalability results from design rather
than after-the-fact micro-optimization, micro-optimization is nevertheless
necessary for the absolute best possible performance and scalability.
Therefore,
\cref{sec:together:Micro-Optimization}
meanders through a few micro-optimizations.
