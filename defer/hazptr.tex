\epigraph{If in doubt, turn it inside out.}{\emph{Zara Carpenter}}

One way of avoiding problems with concurrent reference counting
is to implement the reference counters
inside out, that is, rather than incrementing an integer stored in the
data element, instead store a pointer to that data element in
per-CPU (or per-thread) lists.
Each element of these lists is called a
\emph{hazard pointer}~\cite{MagedMichael04a}.\footnote{
	Also independently invented by others~\cite{HerlihyLM02}.}
The value of a given data element's ``virtual reference counter'' can
then be obtained by counting the number of hazard pointers referencing
that element.
Therefore, if that element has been rendered inaccessible to readers,
and there are no longer any hazard pointers referencing it, that element
may safely be freed.

\end{VerbatimL}
\end{linelabel}
\caption{Hazard-Pointer Storage and Erasure}
\label{lst:defer:Hazard-Pointer Storage and Erasure}
\end{listing}

Of course, this means that hazard-pointer acquisition must be carried
out quite carefully in order to avoid destructive races with concurrent
deletion.
\begin{lineref}[ln:defer:Hazard-Pointer Storage and Erasure]
One implementation is shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:defer:Hazard-Pointer Storage and Erasure},
which shows \co{hp_store()} on
lines~\lnref{store:b}-\lnref{store:e} and \co{hp_erase()} on
lines~\lnref{erase:b}-\lnref{erase:e}.
The \co{smp_mb()} primitive will be described in detail in
Chapter~\ref{chp:Advanced Synchronization: Memory Ordering}, but may be ignored for
the purposes of this brief overview.
\end{lineref}

The \co{hp_store()} function records a hazard pointer at \co{hp} for the data
element whose pointer is referenced by \co{p}, while checking for
concurrent modifications.
If a concurrent modification occurred, \co{hp_store()} refuses to record
a hazard pointer, and returns zero to indicate that the caller must
restart its traversal from the beginning.
Otherwise, \co{hp_store()} returns one to indicate that it successfully
recorded a hazard pointer for the data element.

\QuickQuiz{}
	Why does \co{hp_store()} in
	Listing~\ref{lst:defer:Hazard-Pointer Storage and Erasure}
	take a double indirection to the data element?
	Why not \co{void *} instead of \co{void **}?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Because \co{hp_store()} must check for concurrent modifications.
	To do that job, it needs a pointer to a pointer to the element,
	so that it can check for a modification to the pointer to the
	element.
} \QuickQuizEnd

\QuickQuiz{}
	Why does \co{hp_store()}'s caller need to restart its
	traversal from the beginning in case of failure?
	Isn't that inefficient for large data structures?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	It might be inefficient in some sense, but the fact is that
	such restarting is absolutely required for correctness.
	To see this, consider a hazard-pointer-protected linked list
	containing elements~A, B, and~C that is subjected to the
	following sequence of events:

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Thread~0 stores a hazard pointer to element~B
		(having presumably traversed to element~B from element~A).
	\item	Thread~1 removes element~B from the list, which sets
		the pointer from element~B to element~C to a special
		\co{HAZPTR_POISON} value in order to mark the deletion.
		Because Thread~0 has a hazard pointer to element~B,
		it cannot yet be freed.
	\item	Thread~1 removes element~C from the list.
		Because there are no hazard pointers referencing element~C,
		it is immediately freed.
	\item	Thread~0 attempts to acquire a hazard pointer to
		now-removed element~B's successor, but sees the
		\co{HAZPTR_POISON} value, and thus returns zero,
		forcing the caller to restart its traversal from the
		beginning of the list.
	\end{enumerate}

	Which is a very good thing, because otherwise Thread~0 would
	have attempted to access the now-freed element~C,
	which might have resulted in arbitrarily horrible
	memory corruption, especially if the memory for
	element~C had since been re-allocated for some other
	purpose.

	All that aside, please understand that hazard pointers's
	restarting allows it to maintain a minimal memory footprint.
	Any object not currently referenced by some hazard pointer
	may be immediately freed.
	In contrast,
	Section~\ref{sec:defer:Read-Copy Update (RCU)}
	will discuss a mechanism that avoids read-side retries
	(and minimizes read-side overhead), but has a much larger
	memory footprint.
} \QuickQuizEnd

\QuickQuiz{}
	Given that papers on hazard pointers use the bottom bits
	of each pointer to mark deleted elements, what is up with
	\co{HAZPTR_POISON}?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	The published implementations of hazard pointers used
	non-blocking synchronization techniques for insertion
	and deletion.
	These techniques require that readers traversing the
	data structure ``help'' updaters complete their updates,
	which in turn means that readers need to look at the successor
	of a deleted element.

	In contrast, we will be using locking to synchronize updates,
	which does away with the need for readers to help updaters
	complete their updates, which in turn allows us to leave
	pointers' bottom bits alone.
	This approach allows read-side code to be simpler and faster.
} \QuickQuizEnd

Because algorithms using hazard pointers might be restarted at any
step of their traversal through the data structure, such algorithms
must typically take care to avoid making any changes to the data
structure until after they have acquired all relevant hazard pointers.

\QuickQuiz{}
	But don't these restrictions on hazard pointers also apply
	to other forms of reference counting?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	These restrictions apply only to reference-counting mechanisms whose
	reference acquisition can fail.
} \QuickQuizEnd

These restrictions result in great benefits to readers, courtesy of the
fact that the hazard pointers are stored local to each CPU or thread,
which in turn allows traversals of the data structures themselves to
be carried out in a completely read-only fashion.
Referring back to
Figure~\ref{fig:count:Optimization and the Four Parallel-Programming Tasks}
on
page~\pageref{fig:count:Optimization and the Four Parallel-Programming Tasks},
hazard pointers enable the CPU caches to do resource replication, which
in turn allows weakening of the parallel-access-control mechanism,
thus boosting performance and scalability.
Performance comparisons with other mechanisms may be found in
Chapter~\ref{chp:Data Structures}
and in other publications~\cite{ThomasEHart2007a,McKenney:2013:SDS:2483852.2483867,MagedMichael04a}.

The Pre-BSD routing example can use hazard pointers as shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:defer:Hazard-Pointer Pre-BSD Routing Table Lookup}
for data structures and \co{route_lookup()}, and in
Listing~\ref{lst:defer:Hazard-Pointer Pre-BSD Routing Table Add/Delete}
for \co{route_add()} and \co{route_del()}
(\path{route_hazptr.c}).
As with reference counting, the hazard-pointers implementation
is quite similar to the sequential algorithm shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:defer:Sequential Pre-BSD Routing Table}
on
page~\pageref{lst:defer:Sequential Pre-BSD Routing Table},
so only differences will be discussed.

\begin{lineref}[ln:defer:route_hazptr:lookup]
Starting with
Listing~\ref{lst:defer:Hazard-Pointer Pre-BSD Routing Table Lookup},
line~\lnref{hh} shows the \co{->hh} field used to queue objects pending
hazard-pointer free,
line~\lnref{re_freed} shows the \co{->re_freed} field used to detect use-after-free bugs,
and lines~\lnref{acq:b}-\lnref{acq:e} attempt to acquire a hazard pointer, branching
to line~\lnref{retry}'s \co{retry} label on failure.
\end{lineref}

\begin{lineref}[ln:defer:route_hazptr:add_del]
In
Listing~\ref{lst:defer:Hazard-Pointer Pre-BSD Routing Table Add/Delete},
line~\lnref{init_freed} initializes \co{->re_freed},
line~\lnref{poison} poisons the \co{->re_next} field of the newly removed
object, and
line~\lnref{free_later} passes that object to the hazard pointers's
\co{hazptr_free_later()} function, which will free that object once it
is safe to do so.
The spinlocks work the same as in
Listing~\ref{lst:defer:Reference-Counted Pre-BSD Routing Table Add/Delete}.

Figure~\ref{fig:defer:Pre-BSD Routing Table Protected by Hazard Pointers}
shows the hazard-pointers-protected Pre-BSD routing algorithm's
performance on the same read-only workload as for
Figure~\ref{fig:defer:Pre-BSD Routing Table Protected by Reference Counting}.
Although hazard pointers scales much better than does reference counting,
hazard pointers still require readers to do writes to shared
memory (albeit with much improved locality of reference),
and also require a full memory barrier and retry check for each
object traversed.
Therefore, hazard pointers's performance is far short of ideal.
On the other hand, hazard pointers do operate correctly for workloads
involving concurrent updates, and as of early 2019 are used in production
by both Facebook and by MongoDB.

\QuickQuiz{}
	The paper ``Structured Deferral: Synchronization via
	Procrastination''~\cite{McKenney:2013:SDS:2483852.2483867}
	shows that hazard pointers have near-ideal performance.
	Whatever happened in
	Figure~\ref{fig:defer:Pre-BSD Routing Table Protected by Hazard Pointers}???
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	First,
	Figure~\ref{fig:defer:Pre-BSD Routing Table Protected by Hazard Pointers}
	has a linear y-axis, while most of the graphs in the
	``Structured Deferral'' paper have logscale y-axes.
	Next, that paper uses lightly-loaded hash tables, while
	Figure~\ref{fig:defer:Pre-BSD Routing Table Protected by Hazard Pointers}'s
	uses a 10-element simple linked list, which means that hazard pointers
	face a larger memory-barrier penalty in this workload than in
	that of the ``Structured Deferral'' paper.
	Finally, that paper used a larger and older x86 system, while
	a newer but smaller system was used to generate the data
	shown in
	Figure~\ref{fig:defer:Pre-BSD Routing Table Protected by Hazard Pointers}.

	In addition, use of pairwise asymmetric
	barriers~\cite{Windows2008FlushProcessWriteBuffers,JonathanCorbet2010sys-membarrier,Linuxmanpage2018sys-membarrier}
	has been proposed to eliminate the read-side hazard-pointer
	memory barriers on systems supporting this notion~\cite{DavidGoldblatt2018asymmetricFences},
	which might improve the performance of hazard pointers beyond
	what is shown in the figure.

	As always, your mileage may vary.
	Given the difference in performance, it is clear that hazard
	pointers give you the most ideal performance either for
	very large data structures (where the memory-barrier overhead
	will at least partially overlap cache-miss penalties) and
	for data structures such as hash tables where a lookup
	operation needs a minimal number of hazard pointers.

The next section attempts to improve on hazard pointers by using
sequence locks, which avoid both read-side writes and per-object memory
barriers.
